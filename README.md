## Pitch
With retail and other customer facing SMEs coming under more pressure than ever to compete with large online businesses, the need for greater efficiencies in their brick and mortar premises is paramount. 
Having spent the past 5 years in various retail roles, I observed a missed opportunity for businesses to provide their employees with the tools to manage their workdays more easily and engage with customers more efficiently. Too often,  small businesses make use of disparate systems to deliver functionality such as displaying rotas, communicating with staff, and accessing stock information.
InfiniTeam aims to help achieve some of these efficiencies with a mobile app targeted at customer-facing retail workers. With a single login, workers can:  
•	Access their work schedules and trade up hours with their colleagues.  
•	Send and receive communications such as important reminders and notices.  
•	Work from a shared task list where managers can create tasks and employees can delegate jobs amongst themselves.  
•	Access the business’s stock system to find product information for customers quickly, as well as view and reserve stock in other stores.  
As many smaller businesses may not want to incur the cost of migrating their existing stock database, by using a Parse Server as a flexible middle tier, InfiniTeam can be quickly and easily adapted to plug into any existing stock system’s REST API. 
Built in a mix of Java and JavaScript and based on open source technologies, this project involves both front and backend development with the goal of helping smaller businesses in practical ways.
